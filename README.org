* icloud2caldav 
  This project aims to simplify adding your iCloud calendars to CalDAV capable e-mail clients such as Thunderbird.

** Prerequisites
*** Create an app-specific password
    To allow the access to your iCloud calendars from external applications, you need to create an app-specific password 

    Follow [[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397][these instructions]].
    *Important:* Write down your password, because you won't be able to see it later.
*** Getting the CalDAV URLs
    Run the script using

    #+begin_src shell
      python main.py
    #+end_src

    and enter your Apple ID (your e-mail address) and the app-specific password you created before

    Now copy the desired calendar URLs and add them to your calendar client using the credentials you used before.
